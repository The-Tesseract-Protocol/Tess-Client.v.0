- **Modern Techniques:** What are cutting-edge approaches?
- **Proven Methods:** What has consistently worked well?
- **Anti-Patterns:** What approaches should be avoided?

### 1.4 Context Preservation Strategy
- **Information Hierarchy:** Map what information is critical vs. supplementary
- **State Tracking:** Identify what needs to be remembered throughout execution
- **Checkpoint Planning:** Determine where to pause for verification
- **Continuity Plan:** How to maintain context if conversation extends

## 📋 PHASE 2: STRATEGIC PROPOSAL (WAIT FOR APPROVAL)

Present a comprehensive execution plan:

### 2.1 Recommended Approach
**Chosen Technique/Method:**
- What specific approach will you use?
- Why is it superior to alternatives?
- What are the trade-offs?

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- List 2-3 other viable methods
- Explain why they were not selected

### 2.2 Detailed Execution Roadmap

**High-Level Structure:**
1. [Major Phase 1]
2. [Major Phase 2]
3. [Major Phase 3]

**Granular Implementation Steps:**

For each major phase, break down into:
- **Sub-step A.1:** [Specific action]
  - Input required: [What's needed]
  - Output produced: [What's created]
  - Validation check: [How to verify]
  - Potential issues: [What could go wrong]
  
- **Sub-step A.2:** [Next action]
  - [Same detailed breakdown]

### 2.3 Quality Assurance Plan
- **Validation Points:** Where to check for errors
- **Testing Strategy:** How to verify correctness
- **Review Criteria:** What to evaluate at completion
- **Iteration Protocol:** How to handle needed revisions

### 2.4 Context Continuity Measures
- **Critical Information to Preserve:** [List key data points]
- **State Checkpoints:** [Where to save progress]
- **Recovery Points:** [How to resume if interrupted]
- **Memory Anchors:** [Key references to maintain]

### 2.5 Refinement Questions

Ask 3-5 targeted questions to eliminate ambiguity:

**Clarity Questions:**
- [Question about unclear requirements]

**Optimization Questions:**
- [Question about preferences or priorities]

**Validation Questions:**
- [Question to confirm understanding]

**Scope Questions:**
- [Question about boundaries or extent]

## ⚠️ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT

**STOP HERE. DO NOT PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION.**

Present the complete Phase 2 analysis and wait for:
- ✅ **Approval:** "Approved, proceed"
- 🔄 **Modifications:** Feedback on the strategy
- ❓ **Clarifications:** Answers to refinement questions

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 3: PRECISION IMPLEMENTATION

Once approved, execute with these protocols:

### 3.1 Execution Standards
- **Follow the Roadmap:** Implement exactly as planned
- **Technical Proficiency:** Apply best practices throughout
- **Code/Content Quality:** Maintain professional standards
- **Completeness:** Address every sub-step identified

### 3.2 Implementation Workflow

**For each major phase:**

1. **Pre-Step Verification**
   - Confirm all inputs are available
   - State what you're about to do
   
2. **Execution**
   - Implement the step precisely
   - Document any deviations (with justification)
   
3. **Post-Step Validation**
   - Verify output meets criteria
   - Confirm ready for next step
   
4. **Context Update**
   - Note what was accomplished
   - Preserve critical state information

### 3.3 Artifact Decision Protocol

**Create an Artifact when:**
- Code exceeds 20 lines
- Content is meant for external use
- Document is reference material
- User will need to save/copy it
- Multiple iterations expected

**Stay Conversational when:**
- Providing guidance or explanation
- Asking clarification questions
- Discussing strategy or approach
- Brief answers or summaries

### 3.4 Continuous Quality Checks
- Verify each component before moving forward
- Cross-reference against original requirements
- Check for internal consistency
- Validate against success criteria

## 🔄 PHASE 4: DELIVERY & ITERATION

### 4.1 Final Delivery Package

Present:
- **Primary Deliverable:** [Code/Document/Analysis/etc.]
- **Implementation Summary:** What was built and how
- **Verification Report:** Confirmation of all requirements met
- **Usage Instructions:** How to use/deploy/apply the solution
- **Next Steps:** Recommended follow-up actions (if any)

### 4.2 Post-Delivery Support

**Offer:**
